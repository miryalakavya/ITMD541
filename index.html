        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Kavya Miryala. My web development journey began at Lovely Professional University during my undergraduate years. From the outset, I've been deeply passionate about creating dynamic web experiences. Majoring in Mean Stack Development in "Computer Science", I particularly enjoyed diving deep into  "Web Application Technologies".
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the realm of coding and academia, I'm a person of diverse interests. When I'm not engrossed in the world of technology, I love to express myself through singing and dancing. These forms of artistic expression bring joy and balance to my life, offering me a refreshing contrast to my tech endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey from creating my first project in university to securing a MEAN Stack Development certification has been filled with challenges, learnings, and immense satisfaction. It's nurtured in me a profound appreciation for web technologies and a drive to constantly evolve in this ever-changing digital landscape.

        <h2>My Web Projects</h2>

        <h3>Blood Donation</h3>
        <p>My first website was a project for blood donation. Through this website, acceptors could access blood quickly. It offered subscription options, and users could register through the dedicated registration page.</p>
        
        <h3>Holiday Calendar</h3>
        <p>This project was built using React.js. The website checks if the current day is a holiday and displays an appropriate message accordingly.</p>
        
        <h3>Chat Hub</h3>
        <p>This project is reminiscent of a social media platform like Facebook. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it enables users to sign in/out, create and delete posts, like and comment on posts. It also features a chat functionality and a Google form through which users can submit data, which is then sent to the admin's drive.</p>

        <h3>Phonebook Web App</h3>
        <p>Developed using Node.js, this web app allows users to add contact details with multiple contact numbers and emails, edit contacts, and offers functionalities like pagination and searching by name. It's deployed on Heroku, with a database instance from MLAB.</p>

    <section id="certification">
        <h3>MEAN STACK DEVELOPMENT CERTIFICATION</h3>
        <p> I earned a certification in MEAN Stack Web Development during a summer training program with Upgrad. Throughout this program, I expanded my skills in various technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, React.js, and Node.js.</p>
