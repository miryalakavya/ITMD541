        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Kavya Miryala. My web development journey began at Lovely Professional University during my undergraduate years. From the outset, I've been deeply passionate about creating dynamic web experiences. Majoring in Mean Stack Development in "Computer Science", I particularly enjoyed diving deep into  "Web Application Technologies".
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the realm of coding and academia, I'm a person of diverse interests. When I'm not engrossed in the world of technology, I love to express myself through singing and dancing. These forms of artistic expression bring joy and balance to my life, offering me a refreshing contrast to my tech endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey from creating my first project in university to securing a MEAN Stack Development certification has been filled with challenges, learnings, and immense satisfaction. It's nurtured in me a profound appreciation for web technologies and a drive to constantly evolve in this ever-changing digital landscape.
